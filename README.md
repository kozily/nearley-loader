# nearley-loader

This package is a standard [webpack
loader](https://webpack.github.io/docs/loaders.html) which allows you to load
[nearley](https://github.com/Hardmath123/nearley) parser specification files as
parser rules directly from webpack.

## Usage

Just configure webpack to handle nearley files with this loader:

```javascript
module: {
  loaders: [
    { test: /\.ne$/, loader: 'nearley-loader' }
  ]
}
```

If using with `create-react-app` or any other pre-configured webpack, be sure 
that the `.ne` extension (or whatever file extension you use above) is not 
affected by another loader.  For instance, `create-react-app` will apply a 
url-loader to any file extension it doesn't 
recognize.


Once you've done that, you can now require nearley files in your javascript
modules and you'll get the compiled parser rules:

```javascript
import { Parser } from 'nearley';
import Grammar from './grammar.ne';

let parser = new Parser(Grammar.ParserRules, Grammar.ParserStart);
```
